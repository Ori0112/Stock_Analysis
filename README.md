# Stock_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to helping Steve look into DAQO New Energy Corporation’s stock, for Steve’s parents first investment. Steve is concerned about diversifying their funds and wants to analyze a handful of green energy stock. 

Therefore, we are in charge of analyzing the data that Steve has collected. We will be collecting key stock information using EXcel VBA code to determine if it Steve's parents should invest in DAQO. In the very end we want to make the process as productive as possible and will modify our original code, to help Steve receive the data of the total daily volume and ROI efficiently.

## Background

Steve's parents were mainly interested in finding the total daily volume and yearly return of investments for DAQO, concerned with how actively DAQO was traded in 2018. Our method was to find these KPIs for Steve's parents, as well as, compare DAQO with 11 other green energy stock.  

Using VBA we looped through evey row in our stock data to find the ticker values, and determinte the total volumes and yearly returns for DAQO in 2018. Then we used the same code to run through all the the green energy stocks of 2017 and 2018. In the end, we modified our original code to pull the data we needed more efficiently.
